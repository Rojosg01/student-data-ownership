# Student Data Ownership Smart Contract

## Vision

The Student Data Ownership smart contract aims to empower students with full control over their educational data on the Ethereum blockchain. By leveraging decentralized technology, this contract ensures that students can securely manage, update, and share their academic records, including grades, courses, and certifications. The primary goal is to offer a transparent, immutable, and user-centric approach to data ownership and sharing, enhancing trust and privacy in the management of student information.
