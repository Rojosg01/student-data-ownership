## Vision



The **Student Data Ownership** smart contract is designed to give students complete control over their academic data on the Ethereum blockchain. This contract allows students to securely create, update, and manage their personal educational records, including grades, courses, and certifications. Additionally, it provides functionality for students to share or revoke access to their data, ensuring transparency and privacy in data management.
